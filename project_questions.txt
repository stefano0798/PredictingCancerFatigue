Questions for the meeting:
1) Ask about the correctness of the data selected. Should we consider more data?

2) Ask about the 5 fatigue mesurements contained into the baseline table. Are they referred to the beginning of the chemio
or to the 12 months period after the cancer treatment?

3)Are the RESPNOs from the "hads" table referred to the people's IDs in the "baseline" table?

4)As the height is missing in the baseline table and we need to compute the BMI(Body Mass Index), we considered the average height of women in Netherland, may this work?
(lenght value what is it?)
