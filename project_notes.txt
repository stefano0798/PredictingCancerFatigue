#1 Creation of the RStudio project, init Git repository, import data through Haven library

Usage of Haven library to import .SAV data into R studio (file format: SPSS, file extention: ".SAV")
Data can be found under "/data/Data/" path, each subfolder contains several .SAV datasets depending on the time slot

The collected data has the following structure:
- ID: patient ID
- bdatalg -> fill-in date
- bweight -> weight of patient
- wstab5y -> weight stable 5y
- wcha5y -> change weight 5y
- bwchrea -> reason change
- bwdiet -> attempt to gain weight loss
- bdietres -> result weight loss/gain weight
- educat -> highest education
- eduother -> other education
- bsmoker -> smoker
- yrqtsmo -> year quit smoking
- ageqtsmo -> age quit smoking
- agestsmo -> age start smoking
- smokeyr -> number of year smoking
- bsmokepd -> smoking per day
- balcohol -> alcohol
- balcpw -> alcohol per week
- balcwhen -> when alcohol
- balcoth -> otherwise alcohol
- drugs -> use medication
- menstage -> age menstruation
- bmenreg -> menstruation regularly
- menstcyc -> how many days menstruation
- pill -> contraceptive pill
- pilstage -> age start conc. pill
- pillyr -> number of years of use conc. pill
- pilbrand -> pill brand
- bpilluse -> currenly use pill
- pilqtage -> conc. pill stop age
- pregno -> number of times 
- pregage -> age first pregnancy
- bmencur -> last 24 months period
- menoage -> age last time period
- bmenocau -> reason stopped menstruation
- bmenoth -> other reason stop
- bhormone -> hormone treatment
- bhormrea -> reason hormone cure
- bhormdu -> duration of treatment
- bhormtyp -> what brand of cure
- bfat1 -> fatigue ... 1 - 5
- bfat2
- bfat3
- bfat4
- bfat5
- bfat6
- bfat7
- bfat8
- bfat9
- bfat10
- bfat11
- bfat12
- bfat13
- bfat14
- bfat15
- bfat16
- bfat17
- bfat18
- bfat19
- bfat20 -> fatigue ... 1 - 5
- GROUP -> experienced cancer of not
- TRUE -> willing to be included in research?
- Lenght_avg -> replaces blenght due to error
- ageatinclusion

Import of Data in RStudio and starting to read documentation - 2 hours

#2 Translate Data and first analysis to understand which variables might be more significant

NB: the hypothesis are made to predict the cancer fatigue, so the amount of years a person has smoked will increase the possibility to develop CRF.
Hypothesis: smoking equally dangerous at every age, so we only consider the amount of years (NB: assumption, in reality smoking consequences are related to the age),
	education level and employment situation not relevant,
	alcohol consume per week, generic alcohol per week as we don't have the alcohol type,
	using IBM assuming average height for women in the Netherlands context (168cm)
	pregnancy may influence the risk to develop cancer risk, but is not directly related to CRF.

#3 Second data analysis

Given the above selected data, we will build a RandomForest model to predict the 5 values for the fatigue. As classical RF models have only one output value, we will build 5 models, one for each fatigue value at t4, assuming that the 5 values are independent (general, physical, reducedActivity, reducedMotivation,  .
Deleting records with TRUE set not 1, as they don't give consent to be included in the study.
Then we will cross the physical data of the user (baseline) with some questionnaire answers given at T3, hence 6 months after the chemo. Give this data, we will try to predict CRF values for T4, aka the long term fatigue.
